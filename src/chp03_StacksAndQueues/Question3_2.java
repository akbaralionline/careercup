/*
 * How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, 
 * also has a function min which returns the minimum element? 
 * Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time
 */

/*
 * one simple way to solve this question is to keep 
 * a field minNode in the class, when push in a new Node, 
 * compare the value of the node with that of minNode.
 * 
 * There is one issue with this, if the minNode is pop out,
 * we should travel through the whole stack to find the new minNode,
 * this takes O(n) time.
 * So the worst time for pop is O(n), but the amortized time may still
 * be O(1). is this right?
