/*
 * Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm 
 * which returns node at the beginning of the loop 
 * DEFINITION 
 * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node¡¯s next pointer 
 * points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list 
 * EXAMPLE
 * input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
 * output: C
